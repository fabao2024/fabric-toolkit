# 🧠 Fabric Toolkit

**Fabric Toolkit** is an interactive command-line interface (CLI) based on the [original Fabric project](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric), created by [Daniel Miessler](https://danielmiessler.com).  
This tool was built to simplify the lives of researchers, content creators, and AI enthusiasts by offering a fast and easy way to interact with Fabric’s resources—without the need to remember complex commands.
